Deriving State : 
----------------
- state that is computed from an existing piece of state or from props
- just regular variables, no useState
- cart state is the single source of truth for this related data
- works because re-rendering component will automatically re-calculate derived state

const [cart, setCart] = useState([
 {name : "JavaScript Course", price : 15.99},
 {name : "JavaScript Course", price : 15.99}
]);

const numItems = cart.length;
const totalPrice = cart.reduce((acc,cur) => acc + cur.price,0);
