Practical Guidelines about state :
----------------------------------
- Use a state variable for any data that the component should keep track  of ("remember") over time. This is data that will change at some point. In Vanilla JS, 
that's a let variable, or an [] or {}
- Whenever you want something in the component to be dynamic, create a piece of state
related to that "thing", and update the state when the "thing" should change (aka "be 
dynamic")
Example : A modal window can be open or closed. So we create a state variable isOpen
that tracks whether the modal is open or not. On isOpen = true we display the window, 
on isOpen = false we hide it. 
- if you want to change the way a component looks, or the data it displays, update its state. This usually happens in an event handler function. 
- when building a component, imagine its view as a reflection of state changing over time. 
- for data that should not trigger component re-renders, don't use state. Use a regular variable instead. This is a common beginner mistake.
